## üìå Notes on Category Naming

During the analysis, you may notice that categories like **"Music"** and **"Music & Audio"** appear separately, even though their names seem similar.

This is **not an error**, but a direct result of how Google Play categorizes apps:

- **"Music"** is part of the **Game** categories (e.g., *Magic Tiles*, *Beat Blade*) and typically includes rhythm or music-based games.
- **"Music & Audio"** is part of the **App** categories (e.g., *Spotify*, *Shazam*) and includes music streaming, audio editing, and playback tools.

This classification comes directly from [Google Play's official category definitions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859673?hl=en#zippy=%2Cuygulamalar%2Coyunlar) and explains why these two categories differ significantly in:
